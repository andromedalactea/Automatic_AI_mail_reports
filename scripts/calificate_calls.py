Kathy (Customer Service): You can speak with me. How can I help you?
Sarah (Fronter): Okay, great. I was just reaching out regarding a new federal policy that no longer requires for business owners like yourself to pay those processing fees when accepting credit and debit cards as a form of payment. Are you currently paying those transaction fees when your business accepts credit and debit cards at the moment?
Kathy (Customer Service): Well, I guess my question for you is, so what is your company doing exactly?
Sarah (Fronter): Yes, we are a 0% processing company. We eliminate your processing fees down to a 0%. I do have my manager on the line, they did just join the call, and they can explain in detail how our 0% processing works. Just one moment.
Adam (Closer): Hi, this is Adam Pierce. I'm one of the sales managers here at Aventus Pay. How are you?
Kathy (Customer Service): I'm fine, how are you?
Adam (Closer): Good, good. I'm sorry, I came on kind of late there. I didn't catch your name. Who am I speaking with?
Kathy (Customer Service): My name's Kathy.
Adam (Closer): Kathy, alright. Well, Kathy, so just as you heard, we do have an option here now for folks if they want to stop paying the processing fees, we have a way to get that done. Have you heard of anything called a cash discount before?
Kathy (Customer Service): Mm-mm.
Adam (Closer): Right. So the way it works is our equipment, which we provide for free, is going to show the full true cost now for anyone using a credit card. Where your transaction is normally $100, it's going to show $104 for folks. And if they want to use a discount by paying in cash or check, you can deduct that amount...
Kathy (Customer Service): You know what, I am so sorry, but I have another call coming in, and I do have to take that.
Adam (Closer): Oh, is there a time I should call you back?
Kathy (Customer Service): You know, I don't think that's going to be something we're going to be interested in, but thank you very much. You have a good day.
Adam (Closer): Alright, you too.
Kathy (Customer Service): Bye.
Adam (Closer): Bye.
