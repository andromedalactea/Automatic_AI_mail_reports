May I speak to the business owner, please? It's her. Okay, great. So I was just reaching out about a new federal policy, and it simply states that you no longer have to pay transaction fees. You are currently paying those fees for your business, correct? No, we don't take credit cards. Is there a reason why you don't take credit cards now? Yeah, bad experiences.  Okay. Well, you know, we do offer 0% processing, and I can really assure you that you won't have any bad experience with us, because it's only $25 a month, and we don't have contracts, so you won't be in a contract or anything. It'll just be a month-to-month type of thing. My manager could explain more to you, and she did just have them call. Okay, so what if the client defeats the charge after we did the work?"", 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': ""Hi, this is Treasure, one of the managers here at Adventist Pay. How are you, ma'am?"", 'role': 'user'}, {'content': "" I'm fine."", 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': ""Great. So you were asking about disputes. So we take our disputes very seriously, and we do investigate. So if the client disputes the charge, you're still going to receive those funds. We do same-day processing. So you're still going to receive those funds, and we're going to gather information from you, and the bank is going to do their investigation."", 'role': 'user'}, {'content': ""Yeah, and then the client's disputed again, and then  You guys send them a message, and then they dispute it again, and you guys end up giving in to them."", 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': ""No, we have very low chargebacks. We have very, very low chargebacks. So you don't have to worry about that with us, because we take that part of the business very, very seriously. And as the associate were stating, it's a 60-day free trial. And that's just for you to try out the services to see if it evaluates.  and for you to evaluate it and see if it works well with your company. But we have really low charge back rates here at Aventus Pay. We do not grant. We know customers like to dispute charges and try to get their money back, and that's considered as fraud. So we do not. We take it serious. We don't just give them a slap on the back and send them their funds. So if they made that purchase and we can prove it, they will not get that money back."", 'role': 'user'}, {'content': "" They're going to have...

If they're sharing their location with that app, they can see where were they at this time. I mean, it's not my field, so I can't really break it down exactly how it will work.

So we were losing money on it and then  We had a couple people dispute that we did the work. I then sent the text messages between the client and how they were happy and blah, blah, blah. And then they disputed it two times. They first sided with us, and then the customer kept disputing it, and the bank just gave up and said we would have to take them to small claims court."", 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': ""Oh, no. Yeah, no. We don't work like that.  We're not going to give, you know, if that work was done and you can prove it, we can prove it. We're not going to just give the customers their money no matter how many times they dispute it. You know, we don't operate that way. And as far as you, you're saying that you were paying fees and you wasn't using the credit card machine, with us, there's no processing fee. It's just a $25 monthly fee. And if you went all month and you haven't had not one credit or debit card transaction,  We will waive that $25 monthly payment from you. So you don't have to worry about that.

This is Aliyah, one of the managers here at Adventures Pay. How are you today? I'm good.  Okay, great. So pretty much what we do here is eliminate the fees on your end so that you would start to receive your full proceeds. And how we're able to do so is because of that class action lawsuit that happened against Visa and MasterCard that ruled in the business owner's favor. So now you have the option to either continue taking on the fees or pass over the fees to your consumer.  We do have a toggle option where you can split that fee with the customer 50-50. Our services here are $25 monthly, and that's for unlimited processing. And we also integrate with 95% of POS systems. I'm sorry, did you not know of that, you know, that class action lawsuit? No, I never heard of this policy regarding the processing fees. This is new to me. I mean, I've never been told by any other company.  So you're no longer required to pay those processing fees, like I said, due to Visa and MasterCard. It actually went on the news, on CBNC News, I believe so. It happened about a few years ago. So you guys, you know, are no longer required to pay those processing fees. And a lot of business owners are still paying those processing fees when they don't have to. So that's the reason why we reach out. Are you currently accepting cards?  Do we take, I'm sorry, say it again? Do we take what? Are you currently accepting cards right now? Yeah, I do.

There is for sure processing fees. Okay, and how much are they charging you monthly? Is it like a flat monthly rate fee? No, it's based off the quantitative transactions we do. Okay, okay. So here we actually, you know, we don't charge any other fees. Our services are completely free because we do have a 60-day free trial going on right now.  And it just gives business owners a chance to evaluate our services and see how their customers react. We actually do integrate with Heartland and we can also, you know, provide you with a brand new terminal or the same one that you're currently using. Your only obligation would be if you would like to stay with our services, a flat rate of $25 monthly after.  You know, like after the 60 days they would apply. So our services are completely free and you know, you'll receive 100% of your full proceeds per transaction. Um, you know, your own, your only obligation is that $25 and that's pretty much it. Okay. Um, just, uh, you can, uh,  Oh, another one of our perks here at our company. You'll be set up on automatic batches. So you'll receive those proceeds the same day. And the process is pretty simple, pretty quick. Like I said, I can provide you a brand new terminal, or you can continue to use the same one.

I would like for you to at least send me an email so I can take a look at it.  Because we just switched to Heartland a few months ago, so it's not going to be that simple for me to be able to get away from them because then obviously they lock you into a contract. It's not that simple to get out. So you're in a contract with Heartland right now? Oh yeah, for sure. They all, any company that does the processing, they always sign you up for a minimum of a year to three years.  Okay, just starting, they guys put you guys in a contract instantly? Oh yeah, they always, yeah. There's no way around it. Wow, see that's why we offer, you know, a 60-day free trial to give owners the chance to see for themselves, you know? We actually do buyout contracts here. That's why I said I'm placing you on a 60-day free trial. Did you want to start an information sheet?  Um, just, like I said, send me an email. I have to, again, double check with my business partner. I gotta see what, you know, if he wants to, if he's interested in doing it. I think it's a good idea, but I still gotta talk to him. Okay, is there a time I can give you a call back when you think you'll be done? Yeah, tomorrow morning he'll be in and I'll be able to talk to him. Okay, definitely, Omar.
