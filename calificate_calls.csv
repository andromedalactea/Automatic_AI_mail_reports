I should tell you that right now we're in between switching POS systems and both of those POS systems have their own processing systems to it.  But until we move from one to the other, we're not going to be able to add a third-party processing system. OK. Hey, Chris. This is Jeff. I'm a manager here at Aventus. And so thank you for the information. And congratulations. Sounds like you're about to make a big purchase, huh? We're just switching PLS companies. So we're moving in a different direction. What point of sale system are you guys going with? Spot on.  How soon is that supposed to be completed for you guys? We're going to move over in December. OK. So you wouldn't be willing to do anything until then. What we do, and if it's OK, I'll call you back in December. And I can send you my information if something changes before that. But we have a program we take advantage of.  that's available due to a lawsuit that happened a couple of years ago. And it enables small and medium-sized businesses to pass the processing fees on to customers. And we've got it down to a science where it's just a $25, to you, the customer, it's only a $25 a month flat rate fee for unlimited processing. You set your base prices as your credit card price.  And then when the customer comes to pay, they are offered dual pricing. They can pay the base price that they saw on the menu or wherever, or they can pay the cash pricing at a discount. So instead of like a surcharge, where it's kind of a negative thing, Mr. Customer, oh sorry, you're going to have to pay more for this if you want to use a credit. It's presented as a benefit. You know, hey, here's a  side benefit, if you want to pay cash, you can save some money on this. With Spot On, that's exactly how our credit card processing will be set up with them. For right now, I actually physically can't do anything until December because even if I wanted to go with you, let's say, until December to see what kind of a relationship we can have,  and then implement it into my spot on. I can't change my merchant service with my current POS without signing a new contract agreement, and I'm not going to do that. We already tried to do that once with them, move processing companies, and they said, sure, we can do that, but you need to sign a new agreement. Would it be okay for me to send you some information, send you an email with my contact information in case anything changes?  Okay. What's your email address? So it's thevalepubnyc at gmail.com. Thevalepubnyc at gmail? Yes. Okay. Thank you very much for your time, Chris. It was nice talking to you. You too. I appreciate it. Okay. All right.
